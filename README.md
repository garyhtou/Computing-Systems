### About `CPSC 3500`

CPSC 3500 covers systems programming and introductory operating system design
and implementation. Namely resource allocation, scheduling, concurrency,
synchronization, virtualization, file systems, networking, and security, as well
as the development of concurrent programs (multi-processing, multi-threading)
and client-server networking programs.
